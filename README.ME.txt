Project Overview
Pause Point is an innovative solution created for travelers needing personal space at busy transportation hubs like airports and bus stations. This responsive website allows users to book private mood pods where they can relax, work, or recharge during their journeys.

Inspiration
This project was developed as part of our university's Innovation Hub program. As students who frequently travel between campus and home, we personally experienced the stress of long layovers and crowded terminals. Our motivation came from:

Observing traveler fatigue at airports and bus stations

Recognizing the need for private spaces in public areas

Creating a sustainable business model that enhances travel experiences

Developing a technological solution for modern travel challenges

Addressing mental wellness during stressful travel situations

Our participation in the University Innovation Hub program provided the platform to transform this idea into reality, combining our technical skills with a passion for improving travel experiences.
